### Introduction

### Methods

```{r Total_number_of_patients, echo=FALSE}

source("C:/R/Projects/R-4.4.1-RPythonStudy_Demo/source/my_functions.R")
library(readxl)
raw_data <- read_excel("C:/R/Projects/R-4.4.1-RPythonStudy_Demo/raw_data/deidentified_han20230213.xlsx")
Total_number_of_patients <- nrow(raw_data)
```

### Results

The total number of patients was `r Total_number_of_patients`. The histogram for AGE is shown in Figure 1.

```{r histogram_for_AGE, echo=FALSE}

hist(raw_data$AGE,
     main="Figure 1. Histogram for AGE",)
```


### Discussion

### Conclusion

The title of this demo manuscript was inspired by the paper of de Graaff MR in in 2023 [@knuth84].
